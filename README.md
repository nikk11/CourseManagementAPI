# CourseManagementAPI

This is an API Project for which I have added 3 API's Basically 

1. GetAllCourses()
2. AddCourse(Course course)
3. UpdateCourse(Course course)

Note :- Due to time restrictions i was not able to add so many test cases but that could have been done much better.
As my Last Working day is on 24th April, 2025 - This week only so didn't get much time to spend on this assessment but can be interviewed for those questions and implementations.

So, the business here is to get all the courses listed in the database or to add the course in the database aand update any already existing course in our database.

Here in this project i have used 

1. Logging - Serilog - Console logging
2. Azure Redis Cache - For caching
3. Dependency Injection - For Decoupling
4. Repository Design Pattern
5. Exception handling - using Middleware's
6. NUnit for adding the unit test cases in API side
7. Entity Framwork Core for - ORM tool
8. Azure Sql server and sql database

Note :- I am using my free azure subscription so that i can use the azure sql server and database and i have also added the connection string the appsettings.json so that you can test it.
